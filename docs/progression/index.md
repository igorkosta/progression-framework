# Progression

Describe here your overall approach to a team member progression.
Below you will find an introduction we used at the early days of out team.
------------------

We hired you because we think you're good at what you do.
We firmly believe that work in the our team will help you get better at
what you do.
In order to achieve that we will try to assign you a more experienced peer to
help you start up at the company and guide you through the difficult parts of
the daily work life.
Sometimes we grow to fast and you will be the first man on the `team` or in
`department` without having a mentor. In this case the mentor role will be
fulfilled by your manager. Also if you find yourself in a position where you're
the first person on the team, it means you're the most experienced one and it's
highly probable that you will be guiding and mentoring the new team members
that you will hire.

## Mentoring

From the very beginning, you'll be a very important part of one
of our teams. Your team members will help you to get started and will also help
you along the way.
Everyone in your team is always ready to help and every person on the team can
become your mentor. We'll let you and your teammates decide who will be your
mentor.
In case you will find it difficult to find a mentor, we encourage you to talk
to the software development manager. Together with her you'll find a solution.

## Training
We are still a small team that is trying to achieve something big.
We have to be fast and resourceful. If you joined us then you're ready to be fast and resourceful as well.

Everyone in the team is ready to help you advance your knowledge. Currently we don't offer external training programs. Nevertheless we have monthly tech talks
where you or your peers present the work they've been doing and the learnings
they've made doing it. Given our focus on the banking space, many of these talks
and internal trainings shall focus on performance & scalability optimizations,
secure coding practices and staying on top of the ever evolving cybersecurity
landscape.

We believe that you should constantly improve. Your team will support
you getting better at what you do.

If you feel that you need training or a certain certification, we encourage you
to talk to your manager.
We believe that one of the best ways to learn is to closely work with your team members.

## Code Review
One of the ways, you will learn on the job is during the code reviews. Whenever
you work on a certain task, try to push your code to the repository as soon as possible and create a merge request.
Please, share your merge request with the people you would like to review your
code.

## Pair Programming
We think that pair programming can have a positive impact and improve the
learning effect on the peers participating. Nevertheless, we also believe that
pair programming is not for everyone. We won't force you to pair program, but
if you never tried pair programming, we encourage you to give it a try. If you
don't feel like it's your thing nobody won't force you to keep doing it.
