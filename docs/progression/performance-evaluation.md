# Performance Evaluation

We don't believe in classical employee performance evaluation, that's the
reason why we don't have them.

We work in a fast-paced environment where things can change from one day to the
other and we understand that it's impossible to set the goals for the whole
year. That makes it quite impossible to perform a classical employee
evaluation. That is the beauty of working in startup.

If you want to have a clear goal for the whole year and work towards it - you
will have better luck working for a bigger company.

What we do instead is:

* We believe in one-on-ones and we heavily invest in them
  * We perform one-on-ones weekly
  * One-on-one is your gig not your managers
  * It's the meeting that should help you perform and your best level
  * It's the meeting where you help form our company
* We do yearly peer reviews
  * Every year we choose a team responsible for gathering feedback about all
    employees
  * After all the feedbacks have been gathered and anonymized, every employee
    will get the anonymized peer feedback
  * After you received your peer feedback, you're welcome to start a discussion
    about it during your next one-on-one

## Questions 1-1

Don't forget: one-on-one is your gig and you're the one who asks questions
first.

Some questions your manager can ask your during your one-on-one.

* If we could improve in any way, how would we do it?
* What’s the No. 1 problem with our organization? Why?
* What’s not fun about working here?
* Who is really kicking ass in the company? Who do you admire?
* If you were me, what changes would you make?
* What don’t you like about the product?
* What’s the biggest opportunity that we’re missing out on?
* What are we not doing that we should be doing?
* Are you happy working here?
